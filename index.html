        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p class='bio'>My name is Brooke Mars and I am beginning to learn to code with the goal of becoming a full-stack engineer.
                I am currently following the Codecademy program for this career path and working on it regularly each week.
                Even though it's a challenge, and all very new to me, it is something I am fully committed to and looking forward to learning more about.
            </p>

             <p class='bio'>In my spare time, I enjoy being outside mountain biking, skiing, and paddleboarding. 
                 I also have a cat named Francis that keeps me company while coding and loves to sit on my lap while I'm working on projects.
